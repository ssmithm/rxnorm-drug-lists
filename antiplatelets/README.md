These SAS datasets include antiplatelet drugs described in the accompanying XLSX file. All RXCUIs and NDCs are categorized by medication name (MEDNAME) and class (CLASS). The IN variable indicates the most recent RXNORM monthly release that contained the specific concept (RXCUI or NDC), in the format YYYYMMDD.

**Note that these datasets contain some 2500+ Aspirin RXCUIs and related NDCs, including the entire spectrum of aspirin-containing products, not just aspirin single ingredient products. Depending on the use case scenario (e.g., identifying only chronic users of low- or full-dose aspirin), additional curation of these lists may be needed.
