These SAS datasets include lipid-lowering drugs described in the accompanying CSV file. All RXCUIs and NDCs are categorized by medication name (MEDNAME) and class (CLASS). Combination products have each MEDNAME and corresponding CLASS numbered. The IN variable indicates the most recent RXNORM monthly release that contained the specific concept (RXCUI or NDC), in the format YYYYMMDD.

The lists, and associated information for each entity, are derived from the National Library of Medicine's RxNorm medical terminology.
